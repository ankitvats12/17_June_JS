const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
Output:
console.log(getEvenNumbers(numbers)); // Output: [2, 4, 6]

Question 14:
Write a JavaScript function that takes a string as input and capitalizes the first letter of each word.
Input:

Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of strings as input and sorts them in alphabetical order.
Input:
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date'];
Output:
console.log(sortStrings(fruits)); // Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']

Question 16:
Write a JavaScript function that takes a number as input and returns the Fibonacci sequence up to that number.
Input:
const limit = 10;
Output:
console.log(getFibonacciSequence(limit)); // Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

Question 17:
Write a JavaScript function that takes a sentence as input and checks if it is a pangram (contains every letter of the alphabet).
Input:
const sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog';
Output:
console.log(isPangram(sentence)); // Output: true

Question 18:
Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of those numbers.
Input:
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
Output:
console.log(sumSquares(numbers)); // Output: 30 (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2)


Question 19:
Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of objects representing products and returns the total price of all the products.
Input:
const products = [ { name: 'Apple', price: 0.5 }, { name: 'Orange', price: 0.8 }, { name: 'Banana', price: 0.3 } ];
